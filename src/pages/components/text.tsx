          {`
            HRTimelines is a trans healthcare research project created by trans
            people for trans people. We are looking at the effects of Hormone
            Replacement Therapy (HRT) in transgender individuals through survey
            based research. Our goal is to create better timelines for physical
            effects of HRT while taking into account other factors such as
            application method, dosage, type, and other potential variables like age
            and race.`}

            Our first survey was built in Google Forms and was released in early January 2023.  We returned over 150 responses from trans people all around the world, and have already gleaned many interesting insights.  The data is still being analyzed, but some initial discoveries have already been very exciting.  We look forward to sharing those with you soon.

            working on developing our case study project.  This will collect
            longitudinal data, gaining a better understanding of how HRT affects people over time.`}{" "}

          {`
        Hi! Weâ€™re Lucas (he/they) and Tessa (any pronouns), the founders of HRTimelines. As two trans university students we saw a gap in trans healthcare data and went looking for a solution. The solution happened to be starting HRTimelines, which is our trans healthcare research project! We are two motivated engineering students working to make a difference in a field we only know about from experience. We are not medical professionals, but we are motivated to fill this gap in order to help other trans people and medical professionals looking to start HRT or work with trans patients.

          What follows is a short form that will ask a few basic questions about
          when you realized you were trans, when you came out, etc. It is
          expected to take about 5 minutes. You must be 18 years or older to
          complete this survey. We understand that some of these questions may
          be difficult to answer. You are not expected to have an exact date,
          just a best guess. If you have not yet done one of the things in this
          form (for example, you have not yet started HRT), please leave that
          answer blank. If you have any questions or are interested in helping
          out with the project you can email us at{" "}

        <p>
          Future Plans: Our primary goal is to provide trans people with
          evidence based expectations for their medical transition. The current
          form this takes is through surveys asking health care questions, and
          the presentation of that data. However, in the future we would also
          like to be able to inform trans health decision making, answering with
          evidence key questions about (for example) the effectiveness of
          progesterone or different injection processes.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our Short term goals include:
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>Live data visualization</li>
            <li>
              Increased longitudinal research to gain higher resolution of
              changes over time
            </li>
            <li>Collecting more information on specific parts of transition</li>
            <li>
              Gaining a broader reach into trans communities we do not have much
              contact with
            </li>
            <li>Build a community of volunteers to support the work</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          {`In the future, we are interested in creating better documentation of
          our findings, including reports and detailed reviews. We are also
          considering a podcast discussing the effects and impacts of HRT. We
          are both looking forward to see where this project is going, and are
          always looking for feedback and good ideas. If you would like to get
