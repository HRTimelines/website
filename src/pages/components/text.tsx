            HRTimelines is a trans healthcare research project created by trans
            people for trans people. We are looking at the effects of Hormone
            Replacement Therapy (HRT) in transgender individuals through survey
            based research. Our goal is to create better timelines for physical
            effects of HRT while taking into account other factors such as
            application method, dosage, type, and other potential variables like age
            and race. Currently we are in our second version of the survey and are
            working on creating our case study project which will collect
            longitudinal data. If you are on HRT and interested in participating in
            our project please fill out our survey [link]! You can also sign up to
            be a part of our case study when we launch by filling out this form
            [link form]. If you have any other questions for us feel free to reach
            out via email at hrtimelines@gmail.com or Instagram @hrtimelines.

        Hi! Weâ€™re Lucas (he/they) and Tessa (any pronouns), the founders of HRTimelines. As two trans university students we saw a gap in trans healthcare data and went looking for a solution. The solution happened to be starting HRTimelines, which is our trans healthcare research project! We are two motivated engineering students working to make a difference in a field we only know about from experience. We are not medical professionals, but we are motivated to fill this gap in order to help other trans people and medical professionals looking to start HRT or work with trans patients.
